# Corner Grocer Item Tracker - CS 210 Final Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This project was developed to help the Corner Grocer track how often items are purchased throughout the day. Using a text file of grocery items, the program processes the data and outputs the frequency of each item in three different formats:
1. Individual item search
2. A complete frequency list
3. A text-based histogram

It also creates a backup file (`frequency.dat`) of the data when the program starts.

## âœ… What I Did Well

Iâ€™m proud of how organized and readable my code is. I used a class-based design (`GroceryTracker`) to keep things modular, and followed industry best practices like:
- Inline comments
- Clear naming conventions
- Separate header and source files

---

## ðŸ”§ Room for Improvement

If I had more time, Iâ€™d add user input validation for non-integer menu inputs and improve error handling when opening files. That would make the program more user-friendly and robust.

---

## ðŸ’» What Was Challenging

The hardest part was using `std::map` to store and update item frequencies. I overcame this by reading documentation, referencing zyBooks examples, and writing small test cases.

---

## ðŸ§  Transferable Skills

This project helped reinforce key concepts Iâ€™ll use again:
- File I/O (reading & writing from text files)
- C++ `map` usage
- Structuring code with classes
- Creating reusable functions and readable menus

---

## ðŸ”„ Maintainability

To make this project maintainable and adaptable, I:
- Used a class to isolate data logic
- Wrote descriptive comments
- Used loops and reusable functions
- Kept all file paths and filenames easily editable
